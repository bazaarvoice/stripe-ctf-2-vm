# Stripe Capture the Flag (CTF) 2 in a Virtualbox VM

This repository provides the second Stripe CTF contest in the form of a
Virtualbox VM.

The CTF contest is an exercise for developers at all levels of skill designed to
teach some of the basics of web security. There are nine puzzles, each with its
own set of code to inspect, the first being the easiest and the last the
hardest. To progress to the next puzzle you must solve the current puzzle.
